To complete the assignment based on the provided tasks, follow these steps:

- **Data Preparation**: Download and extract the GHCNd data for the year 2023.

- **Hive Table Creation**: Design and create a Hive table suitable for the GHCNd data, considering the most effective partitioning strategy for efficient querying.

- **Data Loading**: Import the GHCNd data into the created Hive table.

- **Data Organization Inspection**: Utilize Hadoop's WebUI to explore the Hive table's underlying directory and file organization in HDFS.

- **Temperature Analysis**: Develop a HiveQL query to compute the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures for a specified month.

- **Precipitation Data Analysis**: Formulate a query to identify the count of stations with missing precipitation data.

- **Advanced Analysis Using Window Functions**: Apply window functions in HiveQL for advanced data analysis, focusing on a specific analytical goal.

- **Testing and Validation**: Test your HiveQL queries using the 2023 GHCNd dataset. Optionally, validate your queries with datasets from additional years for comparative analysis.

- **Report Compilation**: Draft a comprehensive report detailing your methodology, partitioning strategy, data directory structure, encountered challenges, and include the HiveQL code utilized for the analyses.
